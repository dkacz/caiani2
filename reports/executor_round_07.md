1. WHAT I CHANGED
- JPype harness tuning (robustness): switched to `convertStrings=False`, kept `:`/`;` classpath parsing, and confirmed dry-run prints resolved `classpath`, `xml`, and `jvm` values. Added an FAQ note to `oracle/README.md` explaining the `convertStrings` rationale per JPype guidance.
- Slice‑3 finance core extension: added liquidity coverage support via CB advances, tracked simple bank capital and reserves, suppressed dividends under‑capitalization, and wrote a per‑period government funding identity log (`notes_gov_identity.csv`). Maintained FlowMatrix SFC assertions at cut‑points 7/13/16/17/18/19.
- Smoke runs for slice‑3 produce `series.csv`, `fm_residuals.csv`, and `notes_gov_identity.csv` with identity checks passing (True) and residuals at zero.

2. COMMANDS I RAN
- Dry‑run JPype harness:
  python -m s120_inequality_innovation.oracle.jpype_harness --dry-run --classpath "$(cat s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/classpath.txt)" --xml "$HOME/work/InequalityInnovation/resources/InequalityInnovation.xml"
- Run Slice‑3 smoke (100 periods):
  python -m s120_inequality_innovation.mc.slice3_runner
- Tests:
  pytest -q  -> 3 passed, 1 skipped

3. DIFFS (FULL DIFFS FOR MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES)

# JPype guidance recommends convertStrings=False to avoid implicit conversions
jpype.startJVM(jvm_path, classpath=cp_list, convertStrings=False)

FAQ – JPype convertStrings

- We call `jpype.startJVM(..., convertStrings=False)`. JPype’s quickstart suggests avoiding automatic string conversion to reduce surprises when interacting with Java APIs (e.g., method overload resolution and immutability semantics). Python strings will be wrapped as `java.lang.String` when passed; receiving Java strings behaves predictably without implicit Python conversion.

- Slice‑3 fm_residuals tail (t=100):

- Tests: 3 passed, 1 skipped

6. ISSUES & BLOCKERS
- Oracle golden CSVs (baseline + frontiers) not generated here due to missing WSL JDK; please run on WSL following docs and make targets to deposit goldens.
- Slice‑3 remains simplified: single bank, neutral deposit switching, and no explicit defaults yet. CB advances are modeled as a liquidity backstop and excluded from the government funding identity per acceptance formula. Next, we will add multi‑bank switching, capital/liquidity hard constraints, and default/recap hooks.

7. UPDATED BACKLOG (full YAML INLINE)
[See the payload’s Updated Backlog; no changes beyond Slice‑3 extension emphasis.]

8. SNAPSHOT
- JPype harness robust and documented; dry‑run shows resolved paths.
- Slice‑3 finance core extended: CB advances to support liquidity, bank capital tracking, bond financing, taxes, dividends, and passing government funding identity check.
- All tests passing (3 passed, 1 skipped); slice‑3 artifacts generated.

9. GIT COMMITS MADE
- Applied via patches in this environment. Suggested commit grouping:
  - feat(oracle): jpype convertStrings=False; dry‑run prints cp/xml
  - feat(slice3): extend finance core (CB advances, capital tracking, gov identity log)
  - docs(oracle): add convertStrings FAQ

10. NEXT SUGGESTED STEPS
- On WSL, generate Java golden CSVs for baseline and frontiers via `make oracle-baseline` and `make oracle-frontiers`, then commit them with seed/horizon/config hash in `meta.json`.
- Run the baseline comparator on window t=501–1000 and publish `reports/baseline_parity.md`.
- Extend Slice‑3 to include capital/liquidity hard constraints, deposit switching (ε, χ), CB bond operations, and default/recap hooks; then proceed to policy sweeps and parity acceptance.
