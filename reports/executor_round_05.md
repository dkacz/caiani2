1. WHAT I CHANGED
- Added WSL oracle setup docs and classpath record:
  - `docs/java_wsl_setup.md` with copy/paste commands for OpenJDK 17, cloning, compiling, classpath, and harness usage.
  - `s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/classpath.txt` example CP used by JPype CLI.
- Oracle harness dry-run verified: `python -m ...jpype_harness --dry-run` prints resolved classpath and XML.
- Implemented Baseline Behaviour Slice‑2 (investment, vintage/innovation with t+1 delivery):
  - `core/slice2_engine.py` and `mc/slice2_runner.py` create 300‑period artifacts with strictly positive PROD_C trend, innovation diagnostics, and SFC residual logs.
- Implemented Baseline Behaviour Slice‑3 scaffolding (credit/deposits/policy placeholders):
  - `core/slice3_engine.py` and `mc/slice3_runner.py` producing artifacts and closing SFC at cut‑points (detailed logic to be filled next round).
- Comparator improvements (previous round) retained: Java header canonicalization and parity report writer.
- Makefile targets for ergonomics: `slice1`, `slice2`, `slice3`, and `oracle-setup-dryrun`.

2. COMMANDS I RAN
- Oracle harness dry-run (no JVM launch):
  - `python -m s120_inequality_innovation.oracle.jpype_harness --dry-run --classpath "$(cat s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/classpath.txt)" --xml "$HOME/work/InequalityInnovation/resources/InequalityInnovation.xml"`
  - Output: `JPype harness dry-run: classpath=/home/$USER/work/jmab/bin:/home/$USER/work/InequalityInnovation/bin:/home/$USER/work/InequalityInnovation/lib/*, xml=/home/USER/work/InequalityInnovation/resources/InequalityInnovation.xml, jvm=None`

- Slice‑1 run (100 periods):
  - `python -m s120_inequality_innovation.mc.slice1_runner`

- Slice‑2 run (300 periods):
  - `python -m s120_inequality_innovation.mc.slice2_runner`

- Slice‑3 run (100 periods):
  - `python -m s120_inequality_innovation.mc.slice3_runner`

# WSL Java Setup for S120 Oracle (JMAB + InequalityInnovation)

This guide captures a minimal, reproducible setup on WSL Ubuntu to run the
S120 Java oracle via our JPype harness.

## 1) Install OpenJDK 17 and Git

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk git
java -version
```

## 2) Clone the repositories under `~/work`

```bash
mkdir -p ~/work && cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/S120/jmab.git
git clone https://github.com/S120/InequalityInnovation.git
```

## 3) Compile to `bin/` (javac example)

```bash
cd ~/work/jmab
mkdir -p bin
find src -name "*.java" > sources.txt
javac -d bin @sources.txt

cd ~/work/InequalityInnovation
mkdir -p bin
find src -name "*.java" > sources.txt
# Include jmab/bin and any jars in InequalityInnovation/lib on the classpath
javac -cp "lib/*:../jmab/bin" -d bin @sources.txt
```

## 4) Record classpath and XML

```bash
echo "$HOME/work/jmab/bin:$HOME/work/InequalityInnovation/bin:$HOME/work/InequalityInnovation/lib/*" \
  > s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/classpath.txt
export S120_ORACLE_CLASSPATH="$(cat s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/classpath.txt)"
export S120_ORACLE_XML="$HOME/work/InequalityInnovation/resources/InequalityInnovation.xml"
```

## 5) Dry-run the JPype harness

```bash
python -m s120_inequality_innovation.oracle.jpype_harness \
  --dry-run --classpath "$S120_ORACLE_CLASSPATH" --xml "$S120_ORACLE_XML"
```

## 6) Generate golden CSVs (baseline + frontiers)

```bash
make oracle-baseline
make oracle-frontiers
```

Artifacts are written under `artifacts/golden_java/...` with `series.csv` and
`meta.json` per scenario.
```

4. ARTIFACTS PRODUCED/UPDATED
- `artifacts/python/baseline_slice1/run_001/{series.csv,fm_residuals.csv}` (from prior slice; re-run for checks)
- `artifacts/python/baseline_slice2/run_001/{series.csv,fm_residuals.csv,diag_innovation.csv}` (new)
- `artifacts/python/baseline_slice3/run_001/{series.csv,fm_residuals.csv}` (new)
- `docs/java_wsl_setup.md`, `s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/classpath.txt`

5. RESULTS / CHECKS
- Oracle harness dry-run prints resolved classpath and XML (exit code 0):
  `JPype harness dry-run: classpath=/home/$USER/work/jmab/bin:/home/$USER/work/InequalityInnovation/bin:/home/$USER/work/InequalityInnovation/lib/*, xml=$HOME/work/InequalityInnovation/resources/InequalityInnovation.xml, jvm=None`
- Slice‑1 fm_residuals (t=100): all zero at steps 3,7,12,16,19.
- Slice‑2 diagnostics: `diag_innovation.csv` accumulates trials and successes; `series.csv` shows `PROD_C` trending upward with t+1 effect from innovations; fm_residuals zero at cut‑points.
- Slice‑3 scaffold: fm_residuals present with zeros at placeholders (7/13/16/19).

6. ISSUES & BLOCKERS
- OpenJDK not installed in this environment, so Java oracle cannot be executed here. Docs and CLI are ready; please run on WSL per `docs/java_wsl_setup.md` to generate golden CSVs for baseline and frontiers.
- Slice‑3 currently scaffolds the financial/policy blocks; full logic (credit, deposits, taxes/dividends, CB/bonds, defaults) will be implemented next. The placeholders still keep SFC residuals at zero due to neutral flows.

8. SNAPSHOT
- Oracle setup docs + classpath example added; harness dry-run verified.
- Slice‑2 implemented with t+1 capital delivery and innovation diagnostics; artifacts produced.
- Slice‑3 scaffolding added; artifacts produced with SFC residuals logged at cut‑points.

9. GIT COMMITS MADE
- Applied via patches in this session. Suggested commit grouping:
  - docs(oracle): WSL setup + classpath example
  - feat(slice2): investment/vintage/innovation + runner + diagnostics
  - feat(slice3): policy/finance scaffold + runner
  - chore(make): slice2/slice3 + oracle dry-run targets

10. NEXT SUGGESTED STEPS
- On WSL, follow `docs/java_wsl_setup.md` to install JDK 17, compile the Java repos, record classpath, and generate golden CSVs for baseline + frontiers.
- Run the baseline comparator to produce `reports/baseline_parity.md` (test will auto-run when goldens are present).
- Flesh out Slice‑3 with actual banking, deposits, taxes/dividends, and CB/bonds per Sec. 3 and steps 6–7–13–15–16–17–18–19, keeping SFC residuals ≤1e-10.
