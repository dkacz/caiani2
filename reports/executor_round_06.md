1. WHAT I CHANGED
- JPype harness tuned: switched to `convertStrings=False`, preserved `;`/`:` classpath parsing, and ensured dry-run prints resolved classpath and XML. Added a brief FAQ to `oracle/README.md` explaining the `convertStrings` choice.
- Slice‑3 finance core: implemented a minimal, closed financial circuit in `core/slice3_engine.py` with real flows for taxes, interest (deposits, loans, bonds), dividends, bond issuance, and a per‑period government identity check; logged SFC residuals at 7/13/16/17/18/19. Runner produces artifacts under `artifacts/python/baseline_slice3/run_001/`.
- Oracle WSL docs and classpath example retained; oracle baselines/frontiers still need to be executed on WSL to deposit goldens.

2. COMMANDS I RAN
- JPype harness dry-run:
  - `python -m s120_inequality_innovation.oracle.jpype_harness --dry-run --classpath "$(cat s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/classpath.txt)" --xml "$HOME/work/InequalityInnovation/resources/InequalityInnovation.xml"`
  - Output example: `JPype harness dry-run: classpath=/home/$USER/work/jmab/bin:/home/$USER/work/InequalityInnovation/bin:/home/$USER/work/InequalityInnovation/lib/*, xml=$HOME/work/InequalityInnovation/resources/InequalityInnovation.xml, jvm=None`
- Slice‑3 run (100 periods):
  - `python -m s120_inequality_innovation.mc.slice3_runner`
  - Verified `fm_residuals.csv` last 5 lines and `notes_gov_identity.csv` tail (all True for identity).

3. DIFFS (FULL DIFFS FOR MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES)

File: s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/jpype_harness.py
```
[converted startJVM to convertStrings=False; classpath split logic retained; dry-run prints cp/xml/jvm]
```

File: s120_inequality_innovation/oracle/README.md
```
[added FAQ paragraph explaining the convertStrings=False rationale per JPype quickstart guidance]
```

File: s120_inequality_innovation/core/slice3_engine.py
```
[implemented _log_tx CA/KA helper; Slice3State with minimal stocks; per-step flows: interest (13), taxes+dividends (15–16), deposit market (17, neutral), bond issuance (18), CB advances (19, none). Wrote fm_residuals.csv and notes_gov_identity.csv showing Deficit = ΔBonds + CB_ops − ΔDeposits each period.]
```

4. ARTIFACTS PRODUCED/UPDATED
- `artifacts/python/baseline_slice3/run_001/fm_residuals.csv` (601 lines for 100 periods with six cut‑points recorded per loop).
- `artifacts/python/baseline_slice3/run_001/notes_gov_identity.csv` (deficit identity check, all True in smoke).
- `artifacts/python/baseline_slice3/run_001/series.csv` (placeholder macro columns).

5. RESULTS / CHECKS
- FlowMatrix cut‑points (slice‑3): last 5 lines of fm_residuals.csv show zeros at 13/16/17/18/19 for t=100.
- Government identity: last 3 lines of notes file (t=98–100) show `identity_ok=True` with matching deficit and Δbonds.
- JPype harness dry-run prints resolved paths and exits 0.

6. ISSUES & BLOCKERS
- Java golden CSVs are still missing here due to no JDK on this environment. The oracle harness and WSL instructions are complete; please execute on WSL to generate goldens for baseline and frontiers.
- Slice‑3 currently models a minimal closed circuit suitable for SFC checks and identity tracking; full banking constraints (capital/liquidity), deposit switching, and default/bail‑in hooks are to be expanded next.

8. SNAPSHOT
- JPype harness tuned and documented; dry-run verified.
- Slice‑3 finance core implemented (minimal flows) with SFC residuals logged and per‑period government identity checks recorded.
- Artifacts produced for slice‑3 under `artifacts/python/baseline_slice3/run_001/`.

9. GIT COMMITS MADE
- Applied via patches in this session. Suggested commit messages:
  - feat(oracle): jpype convertStrings=False; dry-run prints cp/xml
  - feat(slice3): implement minimal credit/deposit/tax/bonds flows; SFC cut‑points; gov identity log
  - docs(oracle): add FAQ about convertStrings

10. NEXT SUGGESTED STEPS
- On WSL: run `make oracle-baseline` and `make oracle-frontiers` to deposit golden CSVs for baseline and frontier scenarios (θ, tu). Commit with seed, horizon, and config hash in message and as meta.
- Wire the comparator to the deposited goldens and produce `reports/baseline_parity.md` (window 501–1000); run in CI to store the artifact.
- Expand Slice‑3 with bank capital/liquidity constraints, deposit switching (ε, χ), CB advances/bond ops, and default handling; then move to policy sweeps and acceptance tests.
